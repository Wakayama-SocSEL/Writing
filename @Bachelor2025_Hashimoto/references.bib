abstract = {Open source is experiencing a renaissance period, due to the appearance of modern platforms and workflows for developing and maintaining public code. As a result, developers are creating open source software at speeds never seen before. Consequently, these projects are also facing unprecedented mortality rates. To better understand the reasons for the failure of modern open source projects, this paper describes the results of a survey with the maintainers of 104 popular GitHub systems that have been deprecated. We provide a set of nine reasons for the failure of these open source projects. We also show that some maintenance practices---specifically the adoption of contributing guidelines and continuous integration---have an important association with a project failure or success. Finally, we discuss and reveal the principal strategies developers have tried to overcome the failure of the studied projects.},

abstract = {Context:
Many organizations develop software systems using open source software (OSS), which is risky due to the high possibility of losing support. Contributors are critical for the survival of OSS projects, but very few new contributors remain with OSS projects to become long-time contributors (LTCs). Identification of factors that contribute to become an LTC can help OSS project owners utilize limited resources to retain new contributors.
Objective:
In this paper, we investigate whether we can effectively predict new contributors to OSS repositories becoming long time contributors based on repository and contributor meta-data collected from GitHub.
Method:
We construct a dataset containing 70,899 observations from 888 most popular repositories with 56,766 contributors. Each observation represents a contributor who joined the repository and is categorized as either an LTC or a non-LTC, depending on whether their project tenure is longer than 3 years. Each observation has 31 features that are calculated using the information of the new contributor and the repository when a new contributor joins the project. We build several machine learning models, including naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest to predict LTC validated using 10-fold cross-validation. We compare our best model with state of the art model in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and area under the curve (AUC).
Results:
In 10-fold cross-validation, the precision, recall, F1-score, MCC, and AUC of our best model (random forest) are 0.695, 0.079, 0.140, 0.226, and 0.913, respectively. These values are 27.29%, 92.68%, 86.67%, 56.94%, and 0.55%, respectively better than the best baseline state of the art model (random forest).
Conclusion:
Compared to state of the art models, the models built using our approach use less than 50% features (31 vs 63), have no wait time of one month after the contributor joins to predict future LTC status, and produce better results.}

abstract = {To survive and succeed, software projects need to attract and retain contributors. We model the individual's chances to become a valuable contributor through their capacity, willingness, and the opportunity to contribute at the time of joining. Using issue tracking data of Mozilla and Gnome, we find that the probability for a new joiner to become a Long Term Contributor (LTC) is associated with her willingness and environment. Specifically, during their first month, future LTCs tend to be more active and show more community-oriented attitude than other joiners. Joiners who start by commenting on instead of reporting an issue or ones who succeed to get at least one reported issue to be fixed, more than double their odds of becoming an LTC. The macro-climate with high project relative sociality and the micro-climate with a large, productive, and clustered peer group increase the odds. On the contrary, the macro-climate with high project popularity and the micro-climate with low attention from peers reduce the odds. This implies that the interaction between individual's attitude and project's climate are associated with the odds that an individual would become a valuable contributor or disengage from the project. Our findings may provide a basis for empirical approaches to design a better community architecture and to improve the experience of contributors.},

Contrary to expectations, we confirmed earlier findings of a wide distribution of centralizations even when examining the networks over time. The paper also provides empirical evidence that while change at the center of FLOSS projects is relatively uncommon, participation across the project communities is highly skewed, with many participants appearing for only one period. Surprisingly, large project teams are not more likely to undergo change at their centers.",

abstract = {Modern Code Review (MCR) plays a key role in software quality practices. In MCR process, a new patch (i.e., a set of code changes) is encouraged to be examined by reviewers in order to identify weaknesses in source code prior to an integration into main software repositories. To mitigate the risk of having future defects, prior work suggests that MCR should be performed with sufficient review participation. Indeed, recent work shows that a low number of participated reviewers is associated with poor software quality. However, there is a likely case that a new patch still suffers from poor review participation even though reviewers were invited. Hence, in this paper, we set out to investigate the factors that are associated with the participation decision of an invited reviewer. Through a case study of 230,090 patches spread across the Android, LibreOffice, OpenStack and Qt systems, we find that (1) 16\%-66\% of patches have at least one invited reviewer who did not respond to the review invitation; (2) human factors play an important role in predicting whether or not an invited reviewer will participate in a review; (3) a review participation rate of an invited reviewers and code authoring experience of an invited reviewer are highly associated with the participation decision of an invited reviewer. These results can help practitioners better understand about how human factors associate with the participation decision of reviewers and serve as guidelines for inviting reviewers, leading to a better inviting decision and a better reviewer participation.},
