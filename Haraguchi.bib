abstract = {Use of third-party libraries is extremely common in application software. The libraries evolve to accommodate new features or mitigate security vulnerabilities, thereby breaking the Application Programming Interface(API) used by the software. Such breaking changes in the libraries may discourage client code from using the new library versions thereby keeping the application vulnerable and not up-to-date. We propose a novel output-oriented program synthesis algorithm to automate API usage adaptations via program transformation. Our aim is not only to rely on the few example human adaptations of the clients from the old library version to the new library version, since this can lead to over-fitting transformation rules. Instead, we also rely on example usages of the new updated library in clients, which provide valuable context for synthesizing and applying the transformation rules. Our tool APIFix provides an automated mechanism to transform application code using the old library versions to code using the new library versions - thereby achieving automated API usage adaptation to fix the effect of breaking changes. Our evaluation shows that the transformation rules inferred by APIFix achieve 98.7\% precision and 91.5\% recall. By comparing our approach to state-of-the-art program synthesis approaches, we show that our approach significantly reduces over-fitting while synthesizing transformation rules for API usage adaptations.},
