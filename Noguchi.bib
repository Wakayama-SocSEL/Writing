abstract = {Background: The most important challenge regarding the use of static analysis tools (e.g., FindBugs) is that there are a large number of warnings that are not acted on by developers. Many features have been proposed to build classification models for the automatic identification of actionable warnings. Through analyzing these features and related studies, we observe several limitations that make the users lack practical guides to apply these features.Aims: This work aims at conducting a systematic experimental evaluation of all the public available features, and exploring whether there is a golden feature set for actionable warning identification.Method: We first conduct a systematic literature review to collect all public available features for warning identification. We employ 12 projects with totally 60 revisions as our subject projects. We then implement a tool to extract the values of all features for each project revision to prepare the experimental data.Results: Experimental evaluation on 116 collected features demonstrates that there is a common set of features (23 features) which take effect in warning identification for most project revisions. These features can achieve satisfied performance with far less time cost for warning identification.Conclusions: These commonly-selected features can be treated as the golden feature set for identifying actionable warnings. This finding can serve as a practical guideline for facilitating real-world warning identification.},
